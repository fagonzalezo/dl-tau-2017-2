    "One of the most interesting applications of language models is random text generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model tells us the probability of the next character given the previous ones. We can start from a given text and use the model conditional probability to get a good candidate for the next character, we add that character to our sequence and we keep generating characters in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a character using the conditional probability calculated by the model, $P(c_t | c_{1}, c_{2},\\dots, c_{t-1})$, we will use two main mechanisms: deterministic and  stochastic. For the deterministic we generate the character with the maximum probability. For the stochastic we sample from the conditional probability distribution given by the model. We combine the two strategies using a process analogous to this one:\n",
